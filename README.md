Folate (vitamin B9) is essential for brain development and preventing neural tube defects during pregnancy. However, excessive folic acid (FA) may pose risks. Using mouse models and advanced genetic analysis, we studied how high FA intake during early pregnancy affects offspring brain development. We found changes in genes related to brain growth, neuron function, learning, and memory, especially in certain brain regions. High FA intake particularly impacts developing neurons in the dentate gyrus, altering critical gene expressions and chromatin accessibility. Our research highlights the potential risks of excessive FA intake during pregnancy and its specific effects on brain development.
